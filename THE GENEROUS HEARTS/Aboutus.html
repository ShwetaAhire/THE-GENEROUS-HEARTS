	<p>
        Our world's population is 775.28 crores+ , but not every single human is completely fine.More than 500 million people lives with some form of disabilty.
	</p>
	<p>
		Accroding to a Survey, about 15% of world's population experiences some form of disability.
	</p>
	<p>
        Over 1 billion people live with some form of disability.
        The number of people with disability are dramatically increasing. This is due to demographic trends and increases in chronic health conditions, among other causes.
        Almost everyone is likely to experience some form of disability – temporary or permanent – at some point in life.
        People with disability are disproportionately affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
        When people with disability access health care, they often experience stigma and discrimination, and receive poor quality services.
        There is an urgent need to scale up disability inclusion in all levels of the health system, particularly primary health care.
